    <h1>Why Use The African American Professionals Local Search tool?</h1>
    <p>
      According to the
      <a
        href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/portlandcityoregon/INC110217"
        >US Census</a>, African Americans make up only 5.7% of the Portland, OR population. A
      request I often hear coming out of the African American community is,
      "Where can I find an African American (insert business type here)?" So, to
      answer the call for this specific need I've come up with AAPLS! The
      purpose of this tool is to provide a way for the African American
      community to both refer and search for professional African American
      business services in their area. Need a doctor, dentist, hairstylist,
      handyman? Why not support a black business in your area and search here.
      Know of a great daycare provider, real estate agent, contractor? You can
      now record that referal here to share with others.
