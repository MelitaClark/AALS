About: 

The Idea: according to the us census ( https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045218 ) the United States has roughly a 24% minority population and of the 24% about 13.4% is African American. Once I moved to Portland and connected with the black community, I found myself hearing the same need: “Why is there no website to connect African American businesses with the community?” So, I searched online and found half baked sites that promised to serve you with AA businesses if you provided your location; however, it appeared that these sites were serving up the requested data from some seemingly out of date API source as these queries rendered few results. 

Then I thought, if I could create a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) website that contained a database, then users could login and not only search for themselves, but they could also contribute to the database by adding their own referrals and reviews. A user could search the site by location/business type or search all resources. Once logged in, a user could enter a referral, write a review, edit or delete their reviews. 

In this way, the African American Local Professionals Search App (AALPS) can connect not only African Americans, but all Americans to local African American professionals thus creating awareness and evening out the playing field for these minority business.
