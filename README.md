About: 

According to the US Census (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/portlandcityoregon/INC110217), African Americans make up only 5.7% of the Portland, OR population. 

A request I often hear coming out of the African American community is, "Where can I find a African American _(insert business type here)_?" So, to answer the call for this specific need I've come up with AAPLS!

The purpose of this tool is to provide a way for the African American community to both refer and search for professional African American business services in their area. Need a doctor, dentist, hairstylist, handyman? Why not support a black business in your area and search here. Know of a great daycare provider, real estate agent, contractor? You can now record that referal here to share with others.
